# Hi, welcome to my Ascendion Code Challenge Solution!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

## Original Problem

Homework Assignment: We suggest candidates try to complete this within 30 minutes, but this is dependent on the candidate.

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction. (e.g., a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three-month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
